        "Dora is a bright and talented product designer whom I had the pleasure to manage for the past year. She possesses the uncommon ability to see beyond the pixels and focus on outcomes rather than outputs. She truly strives to understand the impact that her work will have on our customers' experiences, which tremendously helped in delivering great results. She worked alongside other product designers, product managers, product researchers, and engineers on very complicated topics, due to the inherent nature of our projects. She consistently delivered work that was praised by all her stakeholders, often going above and beyond the expectations that were set. Finally, she is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to documentation and building processes. She is well-versed in product design best practices and it shows. That has been critical for us when establishing our product design team from scratch.",

        "What a big pleasure to work with Dora! She is a talented person and super-professional. I learnt a lot from her when it comes to Design process. She has amazing skills to design, structure flows and she can explain you on the easiest way that a non-designer person (like me) will understand completely. Whatever you build, you can count on Dora's expertise and her feedback is always super valuable. Thank you so much Dora for all the knowledge and help me you gave me! That helped me a lot to grow professionally, as well personally.",

        "For me Dora has been one of the most inspiring and supportive partners inside the challenging organisation of Futurehome. I collaborated closely with Dora in forming an ecosystem of tools and licences for the product design team to perform productively, and stay ahead of the competition. Dora showed interest in my particular needs as a prototyper; she effectively conducted research and consulted me on possible tools we could introduce to improve my workflow. She has introduced the company to weekly Design Critiques, and has been an incredible facilitator for each one of them providing designers with actionable ways to improve their designs. Most importantly, Dora raised awareness to key stakeholders about Design; she led company-wide presentations and made plans to establish class-leading design operations, supporting the design team to operate at its maximum potential with workflows based on state of-the-art methodologies and principles, building bridges between different departments with openness, honesty and integrity. I was fascinated when she onboarded several outsourced designers to work temporarily on a project; She supported them with all required knowledge and tools, ensuring they deliver on time high quality outputs, have all the support they need and access to key stakeholders.  She didn’t shy away from getting her hands ‘dirty’ either; She has actively demonstrated high problem solving skills, producing wireframes and high-fidelity designs by utilising our internal design system. She managed to extract knowledge from our engineers and deliver functioning design proposals and prototypes on demanding IoT systems. Concluding, Dora has made a significant impact on my career and she has raised my expectations when it comes to Design and Design Operations. I consider Dora to be a highly valuable asset for any organisation seeking to increase the quality of their design outputs, and to establish firmer connections between design, engineering and other departments that are key for bringing valuable products into the market.",
