          "What if UX research could move as fast as modern product development — without losing its soul?",
          "In this talk, I’ll share how I created an automated, self-service UX testing method. When my global design team was out due to the Norwegian holiday season (but deadlines remained), I was forced to be creative: I built a 100% automated test framework with Figma Make that captured real user behavior - clicks, misclicks, task times, and screen recordings - async, flexible, and scalable. Within a week, we collected quantitative insights from dozens of users while freeing time for deep interviews. I even automated CSV analysis to reduce manual work.",
          "This approach isn’t just a hack - it’s a shift in how UX research can live inside rapid prototyping cycles, powered by creative tooling, async collaboration, and a practical “good enough” mindset.",
          "You’ll learn how it works, what we discovered (the good, the bad, and the hilarious), and how teams with limited researchers, time, or budget can adapt it."
