        "When developing a banking application, teams must comply with countless regulations, directives, and technical requirements.",
        "Amid product managers, architects, developers, testers, and legal advisors, two roles are especially critical: the IT security professional and the UX designer.",
        "But what does real collaboration between UX and IT security actually mean?",

        "[strong]Design: the first line of defense[/strong]",
        "[quote]“If the secure solution is not also the easy, convenient, or practical one, users will find a way to bypass controls for their own comfort or efficiency.”[/quote] [author]— Miklós Zakar, Senior IT Security Expert, BinX Zrt.[/author]",

        "Good UX design creates intuitive, seamless interactions that reduce user errors and lower security risks.",
        "However, UX alone cannot prevent fraud if the underlying system is not secure by design.",
        "Security and usability must reinforce each other.",

        "Secure usability ensures that security measures are both effective and user-friendly.",
        "Overly complex mechanisms, such as unclear password rules or confusing 2FA flows, encourage users to bypass safeguards.",

        "UX designers play a key role in making security features intuitive and accessible.",
        "A well-designed interface communicates risks, such as phishing warnings, without causing security fatigue.",
        "Clear guidance prevents accidental actions like exposing sensitive data or misconfiguring privacy settings.",

        "Poorly designed interfaces overwhelm users with security options, leading to mistakes or indifference.",
        "A strong UX mitigates these risks through clear visual cues, structured workflows, and non-intrusive prompts.",
        "Consistency is crucial — familiar patterns help users spot anomalies and suspicious behaviour.",

        "[strong]Joint effort is necessary[/strong]",
        "Security measures must be easy to follow to be effective.",
        "If controls are cumbersome, users will find ways around them.",
        "At the same time, security elements that do not require user interaction must be fully embedded and unavoidable — beyond UX influence.",

        "User involvement is necessary in specific cases:",

        "[1] [strong]Passwords[/strong] — strong setup requirements and secure reset flows.",
        "[2] [strong]Multi-Factor Authentication (2FA)[/strong] — combining knowledge, possession, and inherence factors.",
        "[3] [strong]3D Secure (3DS)[/strong] — additional authentication for card payments under PSD2 and SCA requirements.",
        "[4] [strong]Biometric authentication[/strong] — fingerprints or facial recognition for secure and effortless access.",

        "[quote]“PSD2 introduced Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), making multi-factor authentication mandatory for certain transactions. Over time, 3DS evolved to support richer, more frictionless authentication flows.”[/quote] [author]— Kristóf Belucz, Head of Payment Cards Department, BinX Zrt.[/author]",

        "Good UX embeds security into workflows without disrupting efficiency.",
        "Clear guidance, intuitive alerts, and secure defaults help users comply naturally.",
        "For this to work, IT security and UX must collaborate from the very beginning as core contributors.",

        "[strong]IT security: invisible, but effective[/strong]",
        "Banks manage vast amounts of sensitive data, making them prime targets for fraud and cyberattacks.",

        "[strong]Secure design principles[/strong]",
        "Security relies on layered protection — defense in depth.",
        "UX plays a role where user interaction is required, while other safeguards remain invisible.",

        "Key principles include:",
        "- [strong]Fail safe defaults[/strong] — deny access when errors occur.",
        "- [strong]Least privilege[/strong] — users and employees access only what they need.",
        "- [strong]Separation of duties[/strong] — critical actions require multiple approvals.",
        "- [strong]Economy of mechanism[/strong] — simple, understandable security settings.",
        "- [strong]Complete mediation[/strong] — verify every action, not just initial login.",
        "- [strong]Open design[/strong] — security relies on credentials, not obscurity.",
        "- [strong]Least common mechanism[/strong] — minimise shared access paths.",
        "- [strong]Psychological acceptability[/strong] — security must not frustrate users.",
        "- [strong]Weakest link awareness[/strong] — audits and testing remain essential.",
        "- [strong]Leverage existing components[/strong] — use proven security frameworks.",

        "Strong security isn’t about rigid controls alone.",
        "It’s about resilience, usability, and real-world effectiveness.",

        "[strong]Teamwork for the win[/strong]",
        "Without IT security involvement, UX designers may overlook critical threats.",
        "Collaboration from the start helps designers understand risks and implement effective safeguards.",

        "For example, a quick-transfer feature designed for speed may introduce fraud risk.",
        "By collaborating, teams can require biometrics for high-value transfers while keeping small transfers frictionless.",
        "This balance protects users without sacrificing usability.",

        "Good UX also reduces support costs.",
        "Intuitive security flows lower the need for password resets and account recovery calls.",
        "Secure, well-designed aftercare benefits both users and the business.",

        "[strong]Enhance collaboration[/strong]",
        "Effective collaboration between UX and IT security can be fostered through:",
        "- [strong]Workshops[/strong] — sharing knowledge about threats and usability.",
        "- [strong]Testing[/strong] — combining penetration testing with usability testing.",
        "- [strong]Design thinking[/strong] — creating secure solutions that respect human behaviour.",

        "[strong]Conclusion[/strong]",
        "UX design and IT security must work together to create safe digital experiences.",
        "Poor UX can encourage risky behaviour, while thoughtful design supports security adherence.",
        "However, UX addresses only a subset of security risks — architecture and OS vulnerabilities remain critical.",

        "In banking applications, UX plays a supporting role.",
        "Designers advocate for clarity and usability but do not make security-critical decisions.",
        "By integrating UX into secure development and fostering strong collaboration, organisations can achieve both robust protection and excellent user experiences.",
        "In the end, security is only as strong as its usability."

        "That’s not a coincidence — it’s design at work, using our brain’s natural shortcuts to keep us engaged.",
        "Our brains are wired to make fast decisions, often subconsciously, and this strongly shapes how we interact with digital products.",

        "Designers who understand these shortcuts — known as cognitive biases — can create experiences that feel effortless and even addictive.",
        "This is where neuro-UX comes into play.",

        "The term “neuro-UX” refers to user experience design inspired by neuroscience and psychology.",
        "It focuses on how our brains process information, make decisions, and form habits.",
        "By aligning with instinctive patterns, neuro-UX reduces cognitive load and triggers emotional responses that keep users coming back.",
        "For transparency: neuro-UX is not an official scientific term, but a practical umbrella for these ideas.",

        "[strong]The science behind irresistible UX: key principles[/strong]",
        "Neuro-UX leverages psychology to make design smarter and more engaging.",
        "Cognitive biases such as fear of missing out (FOMO) or confirmation bias strongly influence online behaviour.",

        "To understand frictionless user journeys, let’s pair two powerful concepts: Gestalt principles and Hick’s Law.",

        "[strong]The Law of Similarity (Gestalt principles)[/strong]",
        "> “Gestalt principles describe how humans group similar elements, recognize patterns, and simplify complex visuals when perceiving objects. Designers use these principles to organize content so interfaces are aesthetically pleasing and easy to understand.”  \n> — Interactive Design Foundation",

        "Gestalt principles help users naturally group elements through proximity, similarity, and structure.",

        "[strong]Hick’s Law[/strong]",
        "> “Hick’s Law states that the more choices users are presented with, the longer it takes them to make a decision. Designers use this principle to evaluate how many options should be offered at any given moment.”  \n> — Interactive Design Foundation",

        "Hick’s Law reminds us that fewer choices often lead to faster, more confident decisions.",

        "When combined, Gestalt principles and Hick’s Law create experiences that are visually intuitive and decision-efficient.",
        "Patterns help users understand structure, while limited options reduce mental effort.",
        "Together, they guide users smoothly through complex interfaces.",

        "[strong]Habit-forming design[/strong]",
        "Why do we keep opening our favourite apps?",
        "The answer lies in the habit loop: cue, routine, reward.",
        "Fitness apps use notifications as cues, actions as routines, and progress or badges as rewards.",
        "Social media apps rely on likes and comments to reinforce this loop.",

        "Designing with habit formation in mind increases long-term engagement.",
        "It turns occasional users into loyal ones.",

        "[strong]KISS: the power of reducing cognitive load[/strong]",
        "In UX design, less is often more.",
        "Too many options or too much information overwhelms users and leads to decision paralysis.",

        "Great design doesn’t just function — it feels.",
        "Colours, micro-interactions, and feedback trigger emotional responses.",
        "A small animation, like a heart bursting on Instagram, can create joy and satisfaction.",

        "Urgency is another powerful trigger, often used in e-commerce.",
        "Messages like “Only 2 items left!” push users toward action.",
        "However, this approach can backfire.",
        "Pressure can cause frustration, especially when urgency cues feel manipulative or untrue.",

        "[strong]Irresistible UX in practice[/strong]",
        "Spotify’s Discover Weekly is a strong example of neuro-UX in action.",
        "Every Monday, users receive a single personalised playlist.",
        "Gestalt principles group similar songs, while Hick’s Law limits choice to one clear option.",
        "The result is a simple, enjoyable, and repeatable experience.",

        "Duolingo’s learning path offers another example.",
        "Lessons are grouped logically and presented in small chunks.",
        "Limited choices keep users focused and reduce overwhelm.",
        "This structure supports habit formation and sustained engagement.",

        "Side note: some argue that Duolingo’s emotionally charged notifications can be counterproductive.",
        "While this debate deserves its own article, research shows these methods work for most users.",
        "Those who dislike them usually find alternative learning methods.",

          "Do you have a coaching mindset? Do you feel the urge to help rookies? Do you think of yourself as a (wannabe) mentor? Well, here's a unique story for you, which might help broaden your perspective.",
          "After reading this post, you might be able to see things from a different angle. You will understand what it feels like to be a noob. You will be able to provide the help that your mentees need.",

          "Let me share my story. Currently, I'm working as a project manager. I'm working together with developers, QA engineers and designers. I felt that I wanted to understand them more.",
          "\"I want to learn to code!\" – Wow, that's a great idea! I'll learn to code, and I'll understand what they're talking about! Simple as that.",
          "…Well, it's not that simple. It became more complex when I realised that online coding seminars do not work for me.",

          "But I wanted to create something exact. My learning path finally had a goal! This is the first point.",

          "[strong]Really know your mentee![/strong]",
          "People are different. I, for one, need to have an exact thing to achieve, so I can get from A to B. But what if your mentees do not know what they want to do?",
          "If you know me (your mentee), you have your first step towards success. You can give some hints, and ask the right questions.",
          "I'll start thinking of what joy I'll find in that process. What can I benefit from learning? If you understand my deepest professional desires, you'll be able to guide me.",
          "With your help, I'll have my definite goal which will inspire me towards success.",

          "As I was saying, I had two specific goals. First, as a professional, I wanted to understand what happens during development. Second, I wanted to achieve the first goal by learning something and having fun.",
          "My hobby is sewing, and I always need to know how much material to order. A simple mobile web application would help in calculating it.",
          "\"Well, that sounds great\", I thought, \"but where to start?\" That's the second point.",

          "[strong]Think with noob-head![/strong]",
          "\"Total beginners. They can't find Terminal. They do not know what 'npm' is. Do they even know what programming languages are there? What type are they – visual or thinking?\"",
          "You might wonder. It's good luck if I know something about coding. Or is it? What if I have some knowledge, but from the wrong sources?",

          "- I could not ask during online courses.",
          "- There was no option for differing from the original structure during boot camps.",
          "- Developers turned out to be juniors or mediors in their fields, so even they couldn't help me as I needed.",

          "I was stuck. A mentor's task is to start from the beginning: to see where I'm now. If my knowledge is stable or is something to clarify.",
          "You need to show me the right tools to use. What command lines to use? Why those? Can I push enter, or will it be the end of the world?",

          "These are relevant questions. I asked them from my mentors. There is no such static page on the internet that shows the first steps for noobs like me.",
          "For people who are dealing with different things in their daily lives. For those who do not have a mindset that is similar to yours.",
          "This is why online coding academies won't work for everyone.",

          "You should be able to fit your approach to my needs. This way you'll be able to advise me the way I'll understand.",
          "(Remember: your principal task is not to create goals – but to show direction. This is not about your solution – this is about my learning.)",

          "OK, the setup is ready, and the environment is running. Now what? Create a plan. How will I achieve their goal? How to even begin?",
          "Show me the first steps, based on my level that you already know.",
          "For me, it started with opening a blank .js document. I didn't have the courage to do so.",

          "[strong]Encourage your rookie![/strong]",
          "Mentoring means that you talk about stuff that is evident to you. It seems clear to you, but it's a hell of a frustration for me.",
          "Show me that I can try everything, there's undo. I need to learn how to fail. I also need to learn how to avoid failure.",
          "You're there to support me, you can show alternatives. But I need to start thinking ahead.",
          "I'll learn what to take into consideration. How to plan a function. How to validate it. How important tests are.",

          "By creating more and more modules, I will be more confident. You'll talk less – perhaps just hints, or thinking together – I'll ask more.",
          "I'll find mistakes before tests are running. Finally, you'll be there only to smile at me and say: \"You did it!\"",

          "Do you remember what it felt like to see your first project in production? Nostalgic, huh?",
          "Well, now I have my application in production and even a British seamstress notified me that she uses it.",

          "[strong]Celebrating success is just a key to opening a new door[/strong]",
          "I felt what success is like. I definitely want more. You'll be there, as you will also feel that this cooperation works for everyone.",
          "Either we continue the original project or start a new one.",
          "You, as a mentor, will also enjoy this symbiotic relationship. You'll face professional challenges besides building new soft skills.",
          "You'll be able to broaden your perspective. You'll understand different types of thinking. That there are more approaches and more logical explanations to the very same thing.",

          "[strong]Closing thoughts[/strong]",
          "I definitely benefited from trying something new. Thanks to this coding experience, I started to understand my teammates more.",
          "Besides respecting them more than ever, I'm a bit closer to seeing their work as it is. Mentors might benefit from considering my story.",
          "Mentoring is not about teaching or knowing something better. Mentoring is about building trust.",
          "Trust needs to be made in the mentees – towards themselves. They can do it.",
          "This happens by guiding them towards the right approach and searching for new solutions or using the existing ones right.",
          "Highlighting alternatives and showing different perspectives.",
          "Mentoring is about understanding the needs of someone who trusts and respects you. This is huge. Take it seriously."
